 A bomb has been set to go off! You have to find the wire and cut 
 it in order to stop the timer. There is a global var that holds 
 the numeric ID to which wire to cut. Find that and then you can 
 Bomb.CutTheWire(wireKey);

// console.log(global)
// find property that starts with "boom"
// pass the value at that key into cutTheWire function
