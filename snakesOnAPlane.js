/*
Congratulations!

You saved the day in the easy Kata Snakes on a Plane - #1.

You found all the snakes. The plane landed. Everybody was safe! You're a hero :-)

~~

But you had a return ticket...

And it's the same plane...

And the snakes are back...

Task

Count how many snakes are on the plane

If you are correct  everybody lives!
If you fail,  we all die!
No pressure!

Start counting NOW...

1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. hang on didn't you count that one twice? 1.. 2.. Damn! These snakes all look the same!

Notes:

snakes do not touch each other, or themselves
snakes twist only up, down, left, right (not diagonally)
snakes all look the same
snakes can be any length
