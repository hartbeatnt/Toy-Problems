/*
Given an array_of_ints, ﬁnd the highest_product 
you can get from three of the integers.
The input array_of_ints will always have at 
least three integers.

Gotchas
Does your function work with negative numbers? 
If array_of_ints is [−10,−10,1,3,2] we should 
return 300 (which we get by taking −10∗−10∗3).

We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.
